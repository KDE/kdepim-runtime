* figure out a better name (than outboxinterface), and decide where to merge
  (in mailtransport?)
* better name for MessageQueuer?
* make sense of CMakeLists.txt... (current version mostly stolen from here and
  there)
* replace StatusAttribute with ErrorAttribute
* Make maildir_resource export its DBus interface, so that we can use the nice
  qdbusxml2cpp.
