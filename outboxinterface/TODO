* figure out a better name (than outboxinterface), and decide where to merge
  (in mailtransport?)
* better name for MessageQueuer?
* make sense of CMakeLists.txt... (current version mostly stolen from here and
  there)
* Figure out a better way to configure the resource via D-Bus.
* Provide an option (attribute?) for messages to be deleted from outbox once
  they have been sent (as opposed to moving to sent-mail).
