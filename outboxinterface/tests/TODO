LocalFolders:
* LocalFolders should be able to recover from any of the following situations:
- maildir resource and collection were removed
- maildir resource was removed, but collections are still there
- one or both collections have been removed

MessageQueueJob:
* Issues with the current test:
- Hangs in shutdownHarder if run with ctest, but runs ok with akonaditest.
  WTF?
- Might still have problems if two instances of LocalFolders (from separate
  processes) try to create the resource at the same time.  This can happen
  in the real world too, so this should somehow be fixed in LocalFolders.
- Slow: runs kbuildsycoca.  Not sure that's avoidable; I think it's because
  the test depends on MT and MT depends on KWallet.
