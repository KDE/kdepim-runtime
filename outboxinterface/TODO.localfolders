* figure out a better name (than outboxinterface), and decide where to merge
  (in mailtransport?)
* make sense of CMakeLists.txt... (current version mostly stolen from here and
  there)

* fix corner case -- it's not as hard as I thought. after fetching
  collections, just make sure they belong to the right resource.
