/**
 * The Akonadi::Filter::ComponentFactory class plays a very central role in the filter management and customisation.
 *
 * It's responsable for the creation of the filter tree components, either standard ones (the Program,
 * the Rule, the RuleList, the And/Or/Not condition etc...) or customized ones.
 *
 * It acts as repository of the FunctionDescriptors that can be tested in filter conditions.
 *
 * It acts as repository of the Actions that the filter can perform.
 *
 * Both in your filtering engine and in your editing program you will need an instance of a ComponentFactory.
 * The factory will have to contain the set of functions, operators, data members and actions that your
 * filtering framework will handle. The same sets are needed on both sides (filtering engine and editing program).
