- Get and install OpenChange's libmapi (http://www.openchange.org)
- Get and install libmapi++ (svn co https://svn.openchange.org/openchange/branches/libmapi++ && sudo mkdir /usr/local/samba/include/libmapi++ && sudo make install)
  *** Note that right now libmapi++ make file assumes samba4 and OpenChange's libmapi are installed in /usr/local/samba ***
