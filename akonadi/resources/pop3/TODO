BUGS
====

- itemcreatejob not executed the second time after first one fails (comment out target collection test)
- gmail ssl not working (still?)
- createJobResult: duplicate messages after cancel
- Status shows percentages instead of full status message sometimes
- After fetching 25 items, only 20 or so are really added to the maildir (not strictly a POP3 problem,
  the items do end up on the server
- additional \n in item
