How To Build
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull ..      <- do not forget the ..
make
make install or su -c 'make install'

where $KDEDIR needs to be set to your KDE installation prefix.

to uninstall the project:
make uninstall or su -c 'make uninstall'

Note: you can use another build path. Then cd in your build dir and:
export KDE_SRC=path_to_your_src
cmake $KDE_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull


Implementation hints
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This code was written during a live tutorial session at the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit 2009, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

It illustrates the ease of writing Akonadi resources, in this case mapping users on the local system as address book entries (i.e. contacts).

The code uses the POSIX API for accessing the system's user database, a cleaner approach would be to use the KUser class provided by kdelibs.

The original code as generated by the KAppTemplate program contained methods that are not needed here (item change notification methods) because this resource is read-only.
So as the very first step they got removed from header and source file.

The directory still contains the files used for the KConfigXT framework for configuring the resource despite this not being implemented here at all.
They might serve as a starting point for experimenting with Akonadi resource behavior, e.g. add an option to filter out user entries where the shell points to "/bin/false"
