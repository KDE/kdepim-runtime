  @brief Makes it possible to share a selection in multiple views which do not have the same source model

  Although <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/model-view-view.html#sharing-selections-between-views">multiple views can share the same QItemSelectionModel</a>, the views then need to have the same source model.

  If there is a proxy model between the model and one of the views, or different proxy models in each, this class makes
  it possible to share the selection between the views.

  @image html kproxyitemselectionmodel-simple.png "Sharing a QItemSelectionModel between views on the same model is trivial"
  @image html kproxyitemselectionmodel-error.png "If a proxy model is used, it is no longer possible to share the QItemSelectionModel directly"
