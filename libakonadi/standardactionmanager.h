/**
  Manages generic Akonadi actions common for all types. This covers
  creating of the actions with appropriate labels, icons, shortcuts
  etc., updating the action state depending on the current selection
  as well as default implementations for the actual operations.

  If the default implementation is not appropriate for your application
  you can still use the state tracking by disconnecting the triggered()
  signal and re-connecting it to your implementation. The actual KAction
  objects can be retrieved by calling createAction() or action() for that.

  If the default look and feel (labels, icons, shortcuts) of the actions
  is not appropriate for your application, you can access them as noted
  above and customize them to your needs. Additionally, you can set a
  KLocalizedString which should be used as a action label with correct
  plural handling for actions operating on multiple objects with
  setActionText().

  Finally, if you have special needs for the action states, connect to
  the actionStateUpdated() signal and adjust the state accordingly.

  The following actions are provided (KAction name in parenthesis):
  - Creation of a new collection (@c akonadi_collection_create)
  - Copying of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_copy)
  - Deletion of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_delete)
  - Synchronization of selected collections (@c akonadi_collection_sync)
  - Showing the collection properties dialog for the current collection (@c akonadi_collection_properties)
  - Copying of selected items (@c akonadi_itemcopy)
  - Pasting collections, items or raw data (@c akonadi_paste)
  - Deleting of selected items (@c akonadi_item_delete)
  - Managing local subscriptions (@c akonadi_manage_local_subscriptions)

  The following example shows how to use standard actions in your application:
@verbatim
  Akonadi::StandardActionManager *actMgr = new Akonadi::StandardActionManager( actionCollection(), this );
  actMgr->setCollectionSelectionModel( collectionView->collectionSelectionModel() );
  actMgr->createAllActions();
@endverbatim
  Additionally you have to add the actions to the KXMLGUI file of your application,
  using the names listed above.

  If you only need a subset of the actions provided, you can call createAction()
  instead of createAllActions() for the action types you want.

  @todo collection deleting and sync do not support multi-selection yet
