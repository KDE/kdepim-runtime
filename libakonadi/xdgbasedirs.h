/**
 @brief Resource type based handling of standard directories

 Developers of several Free Software desktop projects have created
 a specification for handling so-called "base directories", i.e.
 lists of system wide directories and directories within each user's
 home directory for installing and later finding certain files.

 This class handles the respective behaviour, i.e. environment variables
 and their defaults, for the following type of resources:
 - "config"
 - "data"

 Example: getting the Akonadi server config file "akonadiserverrc", assuming
 that Akonadi stores its config in an additional subdirectoy called "akonadi"
 @code
 XdgBaseDirs baseDirs;

 QString relativeFileName = QLatin1String( "akonadi/akonadiserverrc" );

 // look for the file "akonadiserverrc" with additional subdirectory "akonadi"
 // in any directory associated with resource type "config"
 QString configFile = baseDirs.findResourceFile( "config", relativeFileName );

 if ( configFile.isEmpty() ) {
  // No config file yet, get the suitable user specific directory for storing
  // a new one
  configFile  = baseDirs.saveDir( "config", QLatin1String( "akonadi" ) );
  configFile += QLatin1String( "akonadiserverrc" );
 }

 QSettings serverConfig( configFile );
 @endcode
