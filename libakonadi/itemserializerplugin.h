  Base class for PIM item type serializer plugins.
  Serializer plugins convert between the payload of Akonadi::Item objects and
  a textual or binary representation of the actual content data.
  This allows to easily add support for new types to Akonadi.

  <h4>How to write an Akonadi serializer plugin</h4>

  The following describes the basic steps needed to write an Akonadi
  serializer plugin.

  <h5>(de-)Serialization Code</h5>

  Create a class that inherits Akonadi::ItemSerializerPlugin and
  implement its two pure virtual methods, serialize() and deserialize().

  <h5>Plugin Framework</h5>

      plugin. However it might contain a unsuited payload added manually by the application
      developer. Verifying the payload type in case a payload is already available is recommended
      therefore.
      @param label The part identifier of the part to deserialize. @p label will
      be one of the item parts returned by parts().
      @param data An QIODevice providing access to the serialized data. The QIODevice is opened in
      read-only mode and positioned at the beginning. The QIODevice is guaranteed to be valid.
