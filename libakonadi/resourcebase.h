/**
 * This class should be used as a base class by all resource agents,
 * since it encapsulates large parts of the protocol between
 * resource agent, agent manager and storage.
 *
 * It provides many convenience methods to make implementing a
 * new Akonadi resource agent as simple as possible.
 *
 * <h4>How to write a resource</h4>
 *
 * The following provides an overview of what you need to do to implement
 * your own Akonadi resource. In the following, the term 'backend' refers
 * to the entity the resource connects with Akonadi, be it a single file
 * or a remote server.
 *
 * @todo Complete this (online/offline state management)
 *
 * <h5>Basic %Resource Framework</h5>
 *
 * The following is needed to create a new resource:
 * - A new class deriving from Akonadi::ResourceBase, implementing at least all
 *   pure-virtual methods, see below for further details.
 * - call init() in your main() function.
 * - a .desktop file similar to the following example
 *   \code
 * [Desktop Entry]
 * Encoding=UTF-8
 * Name=My Akonadi Resource
 * Type=AkonadiResource
 * Exec=akonadi_my_resource
 * Icon=my-icon
 *
 * X-Akonadi-MimeTypes=<supported-mimetypes>
 * X-Akonadi-Capabilities=Resource
 * X-Akonadi-Identifier=akonadi_my_resource
 *   \endcode
 *
 * <h5>Handling PIM Items</h5>
 *
 * To follow item changes in the backend, the following steps are necessary:
 * - Implement retrieveItems() to synchronize all items in the given
 *   collection. If the backend supports incremental retrieval,
 *   implementing support for that is recommended to improve performance.
 * - Convert the items provided by the backend to Akonadi items.
 *   This typically happens either in retrieveItems() if you retrieved
 *   the collection synchronously (not recommended for network backends) or
 *   in the result slot of the asynchronous retrieval job.
 *   Converting means to create Akonadi::Item objects for every retrieved
 *   item. It's very important that every object has its remote identifier set.
 * - Call itemsRetrieved() or itemsRetrievedIncremental() respectively
 *   with the item objects created above. The Akonadi storage will then be
 *   updated automatically. Note that it is usually not necessary to manipulate
 *   any item in the Akonadi storage manually.
 *
 * To fetch item data on demand, the method retrieveItem() needs to be
 * reimplemented. Fetch the requested data there and call itemRetrieved()
 * with the result item.
 *
 * To write local changes back to the backend, you need to re-implement
 * the following three methods:
 * - itemAdded()
 * - itemChanged()
 * - itemRemoved()
 * These methods are called whenever a local item related to this resource is
 * added, modified or deleted. They are only called if the resource is online, otherwise
 * all changes are recorded and replayed as soon the resource is online again.
 *
 * <h5>Handling Collections</h5>
 *
 * To follow collection changes in the backend, the following steps are necessary:
 * - Implement retrieveCollections() to retrieve collections from the backend.
 *   If the backend supports incremental collections updates, implementing
 *   support for that is recommended to improve performance.
 * - Convert the collections of the backend to Akonadi collections.
 *   This typically happens either in retrieveCollections() if you retrieved
 *   the collection synchronously (not recommended for network backends) or
 *   in the result slot of the asynchronous retrieval job.
 *   Converting means to create Akonadi::Collection objects for every retrieved
 *   collection. It's very important that every object has its remote identifier
 *   and its parent remote identifier set.
 * - Call collectionsRetrieved() or collectionsRetrievedIncremental() respectively
 *   with the collection objects created above. The Akonadi storage will then be
 *   updated automatically. Note that it is usually not necessary to manipulate
 *   any collection in the Akonadi storage manually.
 *
 *
 * To write local collection changes back to the backend, you need to re-implement
 * the following three methods:
 * - collectionAdded()
 * - collectionChanged()
 * - collectionRemoved()
 * These methods are called whenever a local collection related to this resource is
 * added, modified or deleted. They are only called if the resource is online, otherwise
 * all changes are recorded and replayed as soon the resource is online again.
 *
 * @todo Convenience base class for collection-less resources
