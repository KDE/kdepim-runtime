  This class encapsulates a request to the pim storage service,
  the code looks like

  \code
    Akonadi::Job *job = new Akonadi::SomeJob( some parameter );
    connect( job, SIGNAL( result( KJob* ) ),
             this, SLOT( slotResult( KJob* ) ) );
    job->start();
  \endcode

  And the slotResult is usually at least:

  \code
    if ( job->error() )
      // handle error...
  \endcode

  With the synchronous interface the code looks like

  \code
    Akonadi::SomeJob job( some parameter );
    if ( !job.exec() ) {
      qDebug( "Error: %s", qPrintable( job.errorString() ) );
    } else {
      // do something
    }
  \endcode

  Subclasses must reimplement @see doStart().

  Note that KJob-derived objects delete itself, it is thus not possible
  to create job objects on the stack!
