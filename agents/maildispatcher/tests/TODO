* test online / offline
* figure out why ksyscoca is started (it's not the wallet apparently)
* aborttest: test aborting when there is >1 message queued
* test the various SendBehaviours and DispatchModes
* dupetest -> probably faster and more effective if I just use random intervals
  of time between queuing messages
