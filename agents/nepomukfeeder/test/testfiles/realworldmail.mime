Hey,

For Kolab 3.0, we're trying to reuse some of the relevant kdepim 
infrastructure also on the server, specifically:
- kcalcore
- kimap
- kmime
- kabc

We do have the problem though of the huge dependency chain pulled in by 
kdepimlibs + kdelibs, as well as the problem of not being able to make new 
releases of said (sub-) libraries.

Especially now in the beginning I have to add some fixes/new functionality, and 
we need a way to get that on the server in the end.

The preferred way forward is pulling those libraries out of kdepimlibs, along 
the lines of what is happending for frameworks, with only the dependencies 
which are really required.

That would allow us to package & ship the packages we require for our target 
platforms (which is eg Enterprise Linux 6 currently on kde 4.3 and qt 4.6).

Now I can imagine that this is something which is generally planned to be done 
after frameworks is released (as we'd also rather have the strapped down 
frameworks dependencies), but I'd be interested to learn how we can speed-up 
that process and maybe have an intermediate solution, without it being a 
completely separate effort.

After all we really don't want a fork or alike and want to work as much as 
possible upstream.

So are there already plans, or suggestions in what direction such a task could 
be tackled?

I'm at akademy with Jeroen van Meeuwen, who is our Systems Architect with 
Release-Engineering skills, so it would be a good occasion to have a chat on 
how to continue in that respect, and what we can do already now. If you're 
interested/willing to help, tell me.

Cheers,
Christian
