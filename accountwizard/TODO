- figure out i18n for the actual wizards (DONE) - still marked as todo mentioned in the imapwizard
- GHNS support for downloading new wizards -> toma!
- imap+pop3wizard has no encryption as default i.c.w. plain auth method. Not a good default!
- remember which set up resources/transports/ldap accounts/identities belong together so we can offer to remove them in one go again
- add more wizards (In progress)
- sort out password fields at least for pop3.
