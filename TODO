AkonadiControl
---------------
 - rename AgentManager -> ??? and PluginManager -> AgentManager
 - report ProcessControl errors with tracer
 - create resource interfaces on the fly
 - add method instanceAgentType() which returns the agent type of an instance
 - add capability flag 'Resource' and accessor methods to find out whether an
   agent is a resource or not
 - add dbus method to tell the client to configure itself
   (e.g. show a configure dialog to the user)

AkonadiResource
----------------
 - add virtual configure() method to ResourceBase which is forwarded by
   the AgentManager interface


AkonadiServer
--------------
 - add db bootstrapping code, so akonadiserver will create all necessary tables
   and initial data when they are not available (should be part of DataStore)
