- check that a username and a password have been entered in the configuration
  dialog if authentication is required.
  
- see how to get 401 responses and ask the user the new password (and update
  KWallet).

- improve error management when adding items (and possibly in other places).
  
- make all classes thread-safe.

- fetch nearest items in time (say one month around the current date) when
  using CalDAV with a first REPORT, and fetch the rest with a second. This
  should prevent too much delay in korganizer when displaying the events.
