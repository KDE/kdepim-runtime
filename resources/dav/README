==== What's this ? ====

This is an Akonadi resource to access DAV-enabled PIM storages.

Actually only calendars and todo are supported, using either GroupDAV
or CalDAV, but support for contacts (using GroupDAV and CardDAV) is planned.
Finally support for notes over GroupDAV will be added.


==== Build ====

As this is an Akonadi resource still in playground you must copy it
into kdepim/akonadi/resources/ and edit kdepim/akonadi/resources/CMakeLists.txt
to add a line with 'add_subdirectory( dav )'.
