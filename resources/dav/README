==== What's this ? ====

This is an Akonadi resource to access DAV-enabled PIM storages.

Actually only calendars and todo are supported, using either GroupDAV
or CalDAV, but support for contacts (using GroupDAV and CardDAV) is planned.
Finally support for notes over GroupDAV will be added.


==== Build ====

As this is an Akonadi resource still in playground you must copy it
into kdepim/akonadi/resources/ and edit kdepim/akonadi/resources/CMakeLists.txt
to add a line with 'add_subdirectory( dav )'. Then compile as usual.


==== Usage ====

It should be pretty straightforward. The URL to use should be, if possible,
the parent collection of your calendars to allow discovery.


==== Tested with / known bugs ====

Here is a list of servers tested with this resource with the URLs used.
Feel free to contact the author(s) if you successfully tested a configuration
not listed here.

* Egroupware (1.6.002)
  https://host/groupdav.php
  - GroupDAV calendar not fully working : events edition from the client
    deletes them on the backend.
  - CalDAV not working.

* SOGo (version 1.0.4 and 1.1.0)
  https://host/SOGo/dav/<USER>/Calendar
  - GroupDAV calendar working, but the timezone data in the ICalendar
    generated by KCal seems misinterpreted by SOGo : every event is
    shifted by the timezone offset (at least test with TZ Europe/Paris,
    feel free to send your results to the author(s).
  - CalDAV working, with the same bug.
  
* Davical (version 0.9.7.6)
  https://host/caldav.php/<USER>

    and writing capabilities to https protocol).
