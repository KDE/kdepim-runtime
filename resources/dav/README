==== What's this ? ====

This is an Akonadi resource to access DAV-enabled PIM storages.

Calendars and todos are supported, using either GroupDAV
or CalDAV, and contacts are supported using GroupDAV or
CardDAV.


==== Usage ====

It should be pretty straightforward. The URL to use should be, if possible,
the principals URL for your server (CalDAV / CardDAV) or the parent
collection of your calendars to allow discovery.


==== Tested with / known bugs ====

Here is a list of servers tested with this resource with the URLs used.

    generated by KCal seems misinterpreted by SOGo : every event is
    shifted by the timezone offset (at least test with TZ Europe/Paris,

    Get the URL from your Settings->Calendars screen. Find the calendar that
    you want to add to the client, and click on the Export link. There will be
    a popup that displays the CalDAV URL. This is the URL you'll need to enter
    in to your client for CalDAV setup.
    eg. https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/calendars/user/FULL_EMAIL_ADDRESS/UUID_OF_CALENDAR
