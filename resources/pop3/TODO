compare each function with popaccount.cpp, find out what is missing, write it down
password handling / kwallet
for -> foreach
header filtering framework
mail progress items / status messages / done signal
config file migration from kmail
  -> now DeleteLater group

error handling
parents for messageboxes
fixmes
grep for kmail
