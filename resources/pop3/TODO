BUGS
====

- itemcreatejob not executed the second time after first one fails (comment out target collection test)
- gmail ssl not working (still?)
- createJobResult: duplicate messages after cancel
- Status shows percentages instead of full status message sometimes
- After fetching 25 items, only 20 or so are really added to the maildir (not strictly a POP3 problem,
  the items do end up on the server
- additional \n in item
- (!) big fetch test fails

TODO
====

- get rid of "interactive"
- Coding Style
  - astyle
  - rename vars, functions
  - kdebug
  - api documentation (also for fakeserver)
  - for -> foreach
  - clean up includes
  - clean up cmakefiles, remove code duplication with kdepimlibs
  - grep for kmail and remove references

- (!) Implement canceling of a sync
- (!) password handling / kwallet
- (!) Config UI
  -> target collection chooser
      -> auto-create local inbox
  -> make resource name configureable
- unit tests
  - test ssl/tls
  - test with disabled cache
  - all leave on server rules
  - weird bugs in svn log (for example the forcedIdsToDelete stuff)
  - add fails -> second check will still work
  - correct error messages passed from pop3 server?
  - byte stuffing
  - pipelining
  (!) abort requested during mail check
    -> no duplicate messages on next mail check, already added mails added to the seen
       UID list
- compare each function with popaccount.cpp, find out what is missing, write it down
- fix FIXMEs
- error handling
    - parents for messageboxes (or no messageboxes at all and signal error?)
    - mail progress items / status messages / done signal
- listen to collection removals -> complain if no longer there
- proof read and coverage test
- kconfigxt: labels, tooltips, whatsthis etc

Later:

- delete on server: monitor + store item UIDs somewhere
- refactoring: each stage in command classes or such
- header filtering framework
- config file migration from kmail
  -> now DeleteLater group
  -> store-passwd -> store_passwd (also: use_ssl, use_tls and all the others
  -> kwallet?

Missing Stuff
=============

Progress stuff - SSL icons. Needs to be added to akonadi client / progressmanagaer
