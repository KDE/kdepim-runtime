BUGS
====

- itemcreatejob not executed the second time after first one fails (comment out target collection test)
- gmail ssl not working (still?)
- createJobResult: duplicate messages after cancel
- Status shows percentages instead of full status message sometimes
- After fetching 25 items, only 20 or so are really added to the maildir (not strictly a POP3 problem,
  the items do end up on the server
- unit tests: metatype declaration missing
- additional \n in item

TODO
====

make resource name configureable
rename vars, functions
kdebug
astyle
api documentation (also for fakeserver)
(!) kconfigxt
(!) Config UI
  -> target collection chooser
auto-create local inbox
unit tests
  test ssl/tls
  test with disabled cache
  item create storm test (failed to add to maildir!)
  all leave on server rules
  weird bugs in svn log
  add fails -> second check will still work
  correct error messages passed from pop3 server?
  byte stuffing
  pipelining
  abort requested during mail check
    -> no duplicate messages on next mail check, already added mails added to the seen
       UID list
compare each function with popaccount.cpp, find out what is missing, write it down
password handling / kwallet
for -> foreach
header filtering framework
mail progress items / status messages / done signal
  error handling
config file migration from kmail
  -> now DeleteLater group
  -> store-passwd -> store_passwd (also: use_ssl, use_tls and all the others
  -> kwallet?
listen to collection removals -> complain if no longer there
parents for messageboxes
fixmes
grep for kmail
proof read and coverage test
kconfigxt: labels, tooltips, whatsthis etc
clean up cmakefiles, remove code duplication with kdepimlibs
clean up includes

refactoring: each stage in command classes or such
delete on server: monitor + store item UIDs somewhere

Missing Stuff
=============

Progress stuff - SSL icons. Needs to be added to akonadi client / progressmanagaer
