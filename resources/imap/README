The socket is the main connection to the server. It can be replaced by a KSocket as soon as that is ready and can deal with ssl certificates. In that case the db files can go as well. Currently they store the certificates.


To make stuff available through dbus we need to re-generate the xml.
This also needs to be done when you change implementation for the functions.
(can we automate this somehow?)
# qdbuscpp2xml -M -s imaplibresource.h -o org.kde.Akonadi.Imaplib.Resource.xml
