/** @short A QTextCodec for the UTF-7 transformation of Unicode.

    This is a QTextCodec for the UTF-7 transformation of Unicode,
    described in RFC2152.

    Use it as you would use any other QTextCodec. Only if you use the
    encoder directly (via makeEncoder), you should bear in mind
    that if your application needs the encoder to return to ASCII mode
    (like it's the case for RFC2047 mail header encoded words), you
    have to tell the encoder by requesting the encoding of a @em null
    QString.

/** This is a version of @ref QUtf7Codec, which should only be used in
    MIME transfer. It differs from @ref QUtf7Codec only in that the
    encoder escapes additional characters (the RFC2152 "optional
    direct set"), which might not be allowed in RFC822/RFC2047 header
    fields.

    You should only use this codec for @em encoding, since it's output
    is pure UTF-7 and can equally well be decoded by @ref QUtf7Codec's
    decoder.

    To distinguish between the two variants, this class has MIB enum
    -1012 (the nagative of UTF-7) and the somewhat awkward name
    "X-QT-UTF-7-STRICT". The MIME preferred charset name is still
    "UTF-7", though.

    @short A variant of @ref QUtf7Codec, which protectes certain
    characters in MIME transport
