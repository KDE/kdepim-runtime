Intro: Plans for cleaning up libkdepim.

Goal: libkdepim should no longer be a dumping ground of misc stuff for pim apps.

  dfaure thinks that this can move into kdebase (runtime only), but it might be
  needed at compile time too (by uic)? We don't know for sure. The README
  says to move it into kdelibs.  But keeping it in libkdepim isn't right.
  Note that this doesn't seem to be used by anything. dfaure can't recall
  who asked him to whip this up.  Can we find who wanted it and why?
  Else we should move it into an attic.
