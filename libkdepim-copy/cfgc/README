cfgc - The Configuration Compiler
---------------------------------

cfgc generates C++ source code from an XML file containing information about
configuration options. The generated class is bases on KPrefs and provides an
API for the application to access its configration data.

The entries in the XML file are grouped by the tag <group> which takes an
attribute for the config file group name.

The individual entries must have at least a name or a key. The name if used to
create accessor and modifier functions. It's also used as key in the config
file. If <key> is given, but not <name>, the name is constructed by removing all
spaces from <key>.

An entry can optionally have a default value which is used as default when the
value isn't specified in any config file.
